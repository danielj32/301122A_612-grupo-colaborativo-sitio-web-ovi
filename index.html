<h1>Ancient Greece</h1>
<p>
        During the last millennium BC, the culture of Greece and the islands of the sea. Between the years 2000 and 1400 before Christ there existed on the island of Crete a flourishing culture -minoic-, which was displaced by the Mycenaean (1400-1100 BC). 
        To this last one would happen tribes of Indo-European origin, the Ionians, the problems and the Dorians, who came to the peninsula in the successive waves and settled in the valleys and coasts. 
        These towns, origin of the Greek civilization, extend then by the islands of the sea and they are consolidated in the oriental coast of Asia minor.

<p>
        Greek civilization was basically maritime, commercial and expansive. 
        A historical reality in which the geographical component played a crucial role in that the physical characteristics of the southern Balkan peninsula, of rugged relief, complicated agricultural activity and internal communications, while Its long coastal length favored its expansion towards overseas. 
        A phenomenon on which the demographic pressure caused by successive waves of peoples (including the Achaeans, the Ionians and the Dorios) 
        that invaded and occupied the Hellas throughout the III and II millennium BC would also have a substantial impact.
