<h1>Greek Presocratic Philosophy  </h1>
<p>
                Presocrática philosophy is the period of history Greek philosophy that begins with it in the 6th century BC and extends to the last manifestations of Greek thought not influenced by the thought of Socrates (V century BC).

                The presocratic period brings together the first attempts to explain the world is its entirety, being the  "Physus " (nature), the question of the philosophers of this period, using mythology and natural sciences to give them answers.
                
                While other eastern peoples reached a high level of civilization before the Greeks, only the contributions of the Socratic philosophers have made science possible, being an exceptional contribution to the history of human culture.
                
                The Presocrática philosophy is only known by secondary sources (especially Aristotle and Theophrastus) and some fragments transmitted in works of later philosophers (Plutarch, Estobeo), no complete work was conserved.

        Greek civilization was basically maritime, commercial and expansive. 
        A historical reality in which the geographical component played a crucial role in that the physical characteristics of the southern Balkan peninsula, of rugged relief, complicated agricultural activity and internal communications, while Its long coastal length favored its expansion towards overseas. 
        A phenomenon on which the demographic pressure caused by successive waves of peoples (including the Achaeans, the Ionians and the Dorios) 
        that invaded and occupied the Hellas throughout the III and II millennium BC would also have a substantial impact.

        Greek politics was characterized by being the outpost in the ancient world. And he stood out in key things like the right to  <a href="https://i2.wp.com/canitbeallsosimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Akira-manga-dos.jpg">vote</a> 
of all citizens.

<h3> Heraclito  </h3>
<p>
                Few are the things we know of the life of Heraclitus of Ephesus. He was born about 544 BC, 
                and lived in Ephesus, a city located on the Ionian coast, north of Miletus, until his death, in 484 BC. He belonged to an aristocratic family and apparently did not get along very well with his fellow citizens, 
                if we adhere to one of the fragments preserved from his book, and to the testimonies of his contemporaries.

<p>
                The affirmation of change, or becoming, of reality, (this cosmos [the same of all] did not any god or any man, but always was, is and will be eternal fire, which is lit according to measure and extinguishes as measured.) that occurs due to : 1) Opposition of opposing elements, which is interpreted by Heraclitus as tension or war between elements. (It should be known that war is common to all things and that justice is discord and that all things come about discord and need.) However, this "war" is subject to a universal law, the Logos, (which we can interpret as reason, proportion...) that regulates the whole movement of reality leading to harmony, and thus unifying the opposite elements; From where it follows the affirmation of the ultimate unity of all the real. (They do not understand how this, given its variety, can agree with itself: there is a tense harmony backwards, as in the bow and in the lyre.)
